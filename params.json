It has the ability to \r\neither show the count as plain text, or images; and whether or not to count only \r\nunique hits, or all hits. (IP Based)\r\n\r\nPHP 5.3 is currently required due to the use of PHP 5.3+ features. It is a work in progress.\r\n\r\n<h2>Installation</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Open 'counter.php', configure the settings near the top of the script.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create a new folder, named 'counter'.</li>\r\n\t<li>Upload 'counter.php', 'index.html', and the 'logs' directory in ASCII mode.</li>\r\n\t<li>Upload the 'images' folder in BINARY mode.</li>\r\n\t<li>CHMOD the 'counter.txt' and 'ips.txt' files to 0666 (if required). They are located in the 'logs' folder.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Usage</h2>\r\nSimply add the following code to the page where you want the counter to be shown:<br />\r\n<code><?php include './counter/counter.php'; ?></code>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat's pretty much it, really.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
